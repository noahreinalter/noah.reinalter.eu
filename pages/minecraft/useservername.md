# Use Server Name

is a mod that was initially created just to fix one very specific problem, the mod [Bobby](https://modrinth.com/mod/bobby)
creating a new copy of the world every time the server IP changed. Use Server Name tries to fix this
by providing a server id that either the server send to the client or the client can set manually by
using the server name on the multiplayer screen.

Currently, the mod only supports [Bobby](https://modrinth.com/mod/bobby), [Xaero's Minimap](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap) and [Xaero's Worldmap](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map) but
more mods will be added in the future.

The mod is available on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/use-server-name)
The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/noahreinalter/UseServerName)
